                  “Next Level” is the second single released by the South Korean girl group, aespa. The single continues the group’s journey in their fight against the fictional villain dubbed as ‘Black Mamba.’ The storyline of the lyrics
                  was contextualized via SM Culture Universe episode 1 which found aespa losing connections with their aes. In “Next Level” the girls travel to ‘KWANGYA’ or the ‘wilderness’ to stop Black Mamba by diving into the next level.
                  The track is a hip-hop-influenced song that interpolates elements of the soundtrack to the 2019, Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw

            <br /><br /><br /><br />
            I’m on the Next Level Yeah I follow the absolute rules Don’t let go of my hand, unity is my weapon I walk to KWANGYA I know your Home ground Confront the threat, beat it, beat it, beat it
            <br /><br />
            An unexpected Black out, the temptation is deep and strong Letting go of the hands held together, but I’ll never give up
            <br /><br />
            I’m on the Next Level I open the door over there Next Level, I’ll Destroy you in the end Until I reach the Next Level KOSMO Next Level, beat it, beat it, beat it
            <br /><br />
            La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la la La la la la la
            <br /><br />
            I see the NU EVO. The hostile suffering and sorrow Make you Popping and evolve further That’s my nævis It’s my nævis You lead, we follow, after learning the feelings Watch me while I make it out
            <br /><br />
            Watch me while I work it out Watch me while I make it out Watch me while I work it out Work it work it work it out
            <br /><br />
            Even the unbearable despair Can’t break my faith Even if a more painful trial comes I won’t let go of your hand Oh
            <br /><br />
            Never look back Don’t covet things of KWANGYA If the promises are broken, everything will be out of control The signal is becoming unstable since a certain point in time I’ll destroy you in the end Come on! Show me the way to
            KOSMO Yeah
            <br /><br />
            A hallucination quest created by the Black Mamba aespa, They want to separate out ae, that’s right I lose my balance and my voice too In the illusion of being criticized and alienated nævis We (Call ae, ae) aespa’s Next Level
            Open “P.O.S” This is the REAL WORLD, I’m awake We against the villain What’s the name? Black Mamba
            <br /><br />
            I open the door in the end That light is like Fire to you I’m dying to know The next Story that will unfold Huh!
            <br /><br />
            I’m on the Next Level I open the door over there Next Level, I’ll Destroy you in the end Until I reach the Next Level KOSMO Next Level, beat it, beat it, beat it
            <br /><br />
            I’m on the Next Level I become stronger and free Next Level, I’m No longer who I was at KWANGYA Next Level, Feel me I’m like a beast Next Level, beat it, beat it, beat it Huh!
