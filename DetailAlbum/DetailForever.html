                  “Forever” is a single by K-Pop girl group, aespa. It is the first release to come from the quartet since their debut single, “Black Mamba” in November 2020. “Forever” is a remake of a song by the same name by R&B producer
                  & songwriter, Yoo Young Jin. However, this version features new instrumentation and is accompanied by a winter-themed music video.

            With a resemblance I remember the day you came to me A day when the white snow fell silently I fell in love with you at first sight And I knew it would last forever That's how we recognized each other and got closer It's still a
            little unfamiliar But I can see the future Knowing me better than myself Will become a habit of yours
            <br />
            <br />
            Forever Forever I want to give you only pretty things Forever Forever Give you my full heart So that you can live in happiness and love forever I'll always stand by your side Always just like now
            <br />
            <br />
            I know this journey can be hard and lonely at times You can lean on my shoulder then I want to be on your side, Forever Forever As clear as your soul Forever Forever I'll protect it and keep it safe Happily ever after, until the
            beautiful sunset I'll always walk by your side, Forever Forever I want to give you only pretty things Forever Forever Give you my full heart So that you can live in happiness and love forever I'll always stand by your side
            Always just like now
            <br />
            <br />
            Forever Forever I want to give you only pretty things Forever Forever A heart filled with you Happy forever So I can live with love I’ll always be standing next to you As always
            <br />
            <br />
            Forever Forever
